What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I bet it's how you create the .git directory to start tracking the history of the repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?
It doesn't actually affect anything until you say to commit. It lets you set up the commit with
the files you actually want instead of always committing the entire repo. In particular this lets 
you control each commit so it can be per logical step, even if you changed more than one thing

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
It lets you review your commit before making it, line by line.
